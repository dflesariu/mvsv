mvsv - move vid sort vid
problem - a legally obtained collection of movies and series needs to be moved and sorted automatically 
Plan

Setup
- the script stores checksums in a yaml file, it also stores the file/folder name of each item and the decision it makes
- the script receives an "input folder" that will contain a mix of video files and folders
- it creates checksums for each item in the root input folder and stores them in a file for later reference
- it compares the new checksums against its existing database
  - any repeated checksums are ignored
  - any new checksums go the next step

Comparison
- folders that contain a single video file (avi, mkv, mp4, mov, avchd, wmv) will be classed as movies
- folders that contain a single video file shorter than 60 mins will be classed as series
- folders that contain 2 or more video files will be classed as series 

The category is saved together with the checksum and filename / foldername in the yaml file


Move
Items are moved to the corresponding folder, according to the category they received
